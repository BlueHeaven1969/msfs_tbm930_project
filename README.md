# MSFS TBM 930 Project 0.4.11
This is the improvement project for the MSFS default TBM 930.

I suggest using the [msfs-navsystems-performance mod](https://github.com/Smirow/msfs-navsystems-performance) for G3000 extra funcionalities and performance.

([Working-Title](https://github.com/Working-Title-MSFS-Mods/fspackages) guys are also working on a G3000 mod)

And for liveries, see [this thread](https://forums.flightsimulator.com/t/turboprop-master-livery-list/168196/16) on forum.

Current features of this modification are:

* **Removed the 30% gap between 0 and 30% throttle:**

tp_high_idle_throttle_pos = 0; *(default = 30)*

...so then I needed to ajust:

n1_to_shaft_torque_table = ... 68:0.12, 87:0.88 ...

* **Ajusted autopilot maximum pitch:**

max_pitch = 15 *(default = 10)*

* **Corrected some numbers:**

pitch_takeoff_ga = 10 *(default = 8)*

min_n1_for_starter_cutoff = 52 *(default = 50)*

min_n2_for_starter_cutoff = 80 *(default = 200)*

rated_shaft_hp = 850 (default = 0)

CG_aft_limit = 0.355 *(default = 0.36)*

rotation_speed_min = 80 *(default = 90)*

cruise_alt = 31000 *(default = 30000)*

best_glide = 120 *(default = 0)*

* **Ajusted torque vs air density table:**

density_on_torque_table = 0.0005:0.01, 0.0006:0.4, 0.0007:0.5, 0.000850:0.7, 0.000950:0.745, 0.002378:1.000

(Calculated using POH Maximum Cruise Chart)

*(default = 0.0005:0.01, 0.0006:0.4, 0.0007:0.6, 0.0008:0.75,  0.0009:0.9,0.000975:1.0, 0.002378:1.000000)*

* **Landing gear creates more drag (by [PositiveZero](https://forums.flightsimulator.com/u/positivezero/summary)):**

drag_coef_gear = 0.04700 *(default = 0.01000)*

* **Decreased inertial separator effect in torque to 7/8 (now 22%, instead of 25%):**

(L:XMLVAR_InertSep#ID#_Deployment) 14336 * (&gt;K:ANTI_ICE_GRADUAL_SET_ENG#ID#) *(default = 16384)*

* **Fuel flow tweaked:**

fuel_flow_scalar = 0.72 *(default = 1.0)*
ThrustSpecificFuelConsumption = 0.008 *(default = 0.011)*
PowerSpecificFuelConsumption = 0.358 *(default = 0.493)*

* **Added [Uwaâ€™s light mod](https://github.com/Uwajimaya/FS2020) 1.0**

* **Added [kaosfere's dmimmable G3000 panels](https://github.com/kaosfere/msfs-fixes/tree/master/fixes/tbm930_lighting_fix)**

## Known Issues:

- ITT is a big problem. Increasing it makes the engine overheat on the ground, and decreasing it makes it stays too low on cruise level. Asobo's cfg is very limited.

- Inertial Separator is working but not indicating as "ON" in the panel. Light code needs to be fixed.

- Fuel consumption is increasing during climb, which is the opposite that should happen. It's lower than it should be at lower altitudes and higher than it should be at higher altuitudes. Couldn't fix it yet.
